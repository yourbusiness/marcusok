# Example: 100k-Row Export

Large exports are what the Fast stream path is built for: 100k rows run in a Worker in the browser (the main thread only does one structured clone), with Fast stream finishing in ~0.8s.

## Mock data preview

<MockPreview dataset="sales" :rows="3" />

## Implementation

```ts
import { exportExcel } from "@marcusok/excel-exporter";

// rows: sales data from your business layer, fields matching the columns
// below (fetching is omitted here; the scenario uses 100k rows — the live
// demo generates same-shaped mock data)

const result = await exportExcel({
  filename: "large-export-100k",
  sheets: [
    {
      name: "Sales",
      columns: [
        { key: "orderId", header: "Order ID", width: 18 },
        { key: "date", header: "Date", width: 12 },
        { key: "amount", header: "Amount", width: 14 },
        { key: "status", header: "Status", width: 10 },
      ],
      data: rows,
    },
  ],
  mode: "auto", // ≥ 50k rows -> worker + stream
  onProgress: (p) => setProgress(p),
});

console.log(result); // engine: "modern-xlsx", mode: "stream", rowCount: 100000
```

## Notes

- At 100k rows `auto` picks `worker + Fast stream`: ~0.8s measured (vs 17.5s on the Workbook path);
- Stream v1 **supports multi-row headers and merges**, but does **not** support styles/width/freeze/filter; a console warning is expected;
- `onProgress` reports every 1000 rows;
- Set `decimals` explicitly on numeric columns for value consistency with the Workbook path.

Compare `auto` vs `main` at 100,000 rows in the [play](/play).
